# Bun `Function` constructor TypeScript

Bun doesn't support TypeScript when passing the source code to use in `Function`
constructor invocation.

I reported this issue here: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/11976.

As of writing, the issue was not triaged, there is no indication on whether Bun
will consider this and implement it or reject the idea.
